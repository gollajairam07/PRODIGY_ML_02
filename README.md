 Imagine being able to group retail store customers based on their purchase history! 🛍️ As a Machine Learning Intern at Prodigy InfoTech, I had the incredible opportunity to dive into the world of data analysis and create a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers. 📊

🔍 With this innovative approach, we were able to uncover hidden patterns in the purchasing behavior of our retail store's customers. 🛒 The K-means algorithm allowed us to group similar customers together, enabling the store to tailor marketing strategies and offer personalized recommendations.
